# A Simple Note Taking App In Flask

In this repository I use [flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/) a python microservive framework to build a simple note taking app. To run the the application, you need to have flask installed on your device alongside the following modules:

+ flask_login
+ flask_sqlalchemy
+ flask_admin
